Title: Colab AI helped make my code faster
Me: Colab AI said I can use list comprehension instead of a for-loop. Is that safe?
Colab AI: Yes. It does the same thing but faster.
Me: I will test both.
Colab AI: Use timeit to compare.
Reflection: I learned that Colab AI can improve my code speed easily.
