Title: Using dropdown input to reduce user errors
Me: I want to stop users from typing wrong city names. Can I use dropdown lists?
AI: Yes. Dropdowns give fixed choices, so users cannot type wrong text. It also needs less validation.
Me: Will that make it faster?
AI: A little bit faster and more stable. It avoids wrong API calls.
Reflection: I learned that simple dropdowns make the program cleaner and safer.
