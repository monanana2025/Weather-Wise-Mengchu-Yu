Title: Keep UI and data in different parts
Me: Can I put date selection inside the data function?
AI: Better not. UI and data code should be in different sections.
Me: So data only gets weather and UI only shows results?
AI: Yes. That is good modular design.
Reflection: I understood how to separate logic and make the code easy to test.
