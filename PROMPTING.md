## 1. Input Optimisation
**Technique:** I asked AI how to make user input safer and easier.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “Should I use dropdown menus instead of letting users type city names?”  

**What I learned:**  
I used dropdown menus instead of free typing to stop wrong inputs and reduce extra validation.  
The UI became cleaner and more stable.

## 2. Modular Design
**Technique:** I asked AI how to separate UI and data code.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “Is it okay to add date selection inside the data function?”  

**What I learned:**  
UI and data parts should be written separately.  
This makes the notebook clear and easy to update in the future.

## 3. API Error 405
**Technique:** I asked AI for help to fix an API error.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “I got error 405 when testing the API. Is my key wrong?”  

**What I learned:**  
The problem was using the wrong request method, not the API key.  
I now understand what HTTP status codes mean.

## 4. Colab–GitHub Saving Issue
**Technique:** I asked AI why Colab could not save after running widgets.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “Why can’t I save my notebook to GitHub after running the UI?”  

**What I learned:**  
Colab cannot save notebooks when widgets are active.  
The simple fix is to reload or restart before saving.

## 5. Testing Without API Key
**Technique:** I asked AI if I can upload the project without an API key.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “If I remove my key before upload, will the code still work?”  

**What I learned:**  
The project can still be tested with mock APIs.  
It improved my understanding of code security.

## 6. Colab AI Code Optimisation
**Technique:** I used Colab AI to check code performance.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “Is list comprehension faster than for-loop?”  

**What I learned:**  
Colab AI showed me that list comprehension is faster and cleaner.  
I made my loops shorter and the program ran better.

## 7. Visualisation Design
**Technique:** I asked AI how to make my chart easier to read.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “How can I improve my temperature chart?”  

**What I learned:**  
Adding labels, legends, and titles made my chart clearer.  
This improved user experience and readability.

---

## 8. Error Handling
**Technique:** I asked AI how to stop my notebook from crashing.  
**Example:**  
Prompt: “When users type a wrong city name, how can I avoid an error?” 

**What I learned:**  
I added `try/except` to catch invalid input.  
Now the program shows a message instead of crashing.
